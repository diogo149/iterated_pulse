* TODOs
- [X] chang the drive downloading to locally downloaded files
- [X] iterative generation using perpendicular init
- [X] perpendicular projection optimizer
- [X] try iterative w/ latents only (not noise)
- [X] make grid of samples
  - make grid utility
- [X] make plan of what to run
  - runs w/ 25 samples ?
  - configurations:
    - vanilla_pulse
    - iterative_negation_initialization
    - iterative_perpendicular_initialization
    - perpendicular_projection_optimizer
    - perpendicular_projection_optimizer_only_latents
- [X] try psi = 0.7
- [X] farthest_sampled_initailization
- [X] tried eps = 0.0
- [X] use D to make realistic samples
  - hypothesis: higher number = less real
  - [X] use aux loss
    - "100*L2+0.05*GEOCROSS"
    - try: 0.05 for DISC loss
      - seemed too high
    - try: 0.02
      - still way too high
    - try: 0.01
      - still way too high
      - looks like adversarial examples for D
    - 0.003
  - [X] rejection sampling
- [X] code cleanup
  - add psi=0.7 option
  - add "100*L2+0.05*GEOCROSS+0.01*DISC"
  - flag for rejection sampling
    - filter_results_with_D
  - flag for sortby_D
- [X] run all configs on oprah
- [X] package up code nicely (so that others can use)
- [ ] make animation of interpolation of samples
